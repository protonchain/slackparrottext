# slackparrottext

Basically just run the notebook and call parrot with the text that you want

Single words only, no punctuation and the letters are auto capitalized

You can modify letters.csv if you like to make the letters look different, but I wouldn't try to

Attaching a blank emoji in case your slack doesn't have a blank emoji

You can change the emoji that's used in the partype parameter, and the number of spaces in the numspaces parameter
