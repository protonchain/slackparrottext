# slackparrottext

Basically just run the script and call parrot with the text that you want

If you want the parrots to do a wave, instead summon waveparrot with the text you want and copy that into slack

Letters are auto capitalized, no punctuation (yet). You can have multiple words, just don't make them
too long.

You can modify letters.csv if you like to make the letters look different.

Attaching a blank emoji in case your slack doesn't have a blank emoji

You can change the emoji that's used in the partype parameter, and the number of spaces in the numspaces parameter
